# Machine Learning Engineer Programme - Exercise 4

Task 1 is about using AWS, task 2 is a study on compute environment in AWS.

## Task 1

Use AWS Lambda for running the model (train and predict) created in previous exercise (task 1. might be more amenable).

1. Login to AWS
  * For Solita sandbox login, see: https://intra.solita.fi/display/RJO/Solita+AWS+Sandbox+login
  * Change to Ireland region (`eu-west-1`, console will remember this after first login)

2. Create Cloudformation stack by using: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ml-engineer/cloudformation/ml-stack.yml
  * Name the stack as `mle4-<username>`
  * This will create the following resources:
    * Two Lambda functions
      * `mle4-<username>-train` for training the model
      * `mle4-<username>-predict` for using a trained model for prediction
    * API Gateway REST API named `mle4-<username>`
      * With `/` route mapped to `mle4-<username>-predict` Lambda
    * S3 Bucket named `mle4-<username>`
      * Intended for model storage, train Lambda creates `model.pkl` file, persisted with joblib
  * Go to Cloudformation console https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-west-1#/stacks?filter=active
    * Press `Create Stack` button
    * Select `Specify an Amazon S3 template URL`: with value https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ml-engineer/cloudformation/ml-stack.yml
      * and press Next
    * Name the stack as: `mle4-<username>` and press Next
    * Accept default values on the next page ("Options") and press Next
    * On Review page:
      * Under Capabilities, check options:
        * I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources.
        * I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.
      * On Transform section, press "Create Change Set" button
        * Wait until list of resources is shown
        * Then press Execute
        * Wait until Status is CREATE_COMPLETE
      
3. Train the example model by running `mle4-<username>-train` Lambda
4. Test the example model by running `mle4-<username>-predict` Lambda
  * Configure a test event:
  ```
  {"queryStringParameters":
    {"sepal_length": 1,
     "sepal_width": 1,
     "petal_length": 1,
     "petal_width": 1}}
  ```
5. Test the sample API Gateway
  * Select `GET` method of `/` resource
  * Press `Test` and pass query string: `?sepal_length=1&sepal_width=1&petal_length=1&petal_width=1`
6. Deploy the sample API
  * Click `Actions`, select `Deploy API`
  * Create new stage named `dev` and click `Deploy`
  * Browse to the URL, pass query string
7. Plug your own algorithm and model
8. Test it
9. Deploy and share link to the API to Slack

## Task 2

Study machine learning compute environments available in AWS. This might be a good time to look into Sagemaker service,
if you'r not already familiar with it: https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/

If you also try out AWS services, it's a good idea to tag the resources with `project: ml-engineer`.

Idea is to discuss about the compute environments in the exercise meeting on 27.4.2018.
